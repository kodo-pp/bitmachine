# BitMachine

**WARNING**: work is still in progress. What you see here is just an MVP of an MVP of an MVP.
Almost no necessary native functions are implemented, there are most likely bugs and the whole
thing spits out tons of shit into stdout. Yet, **some** examples **appear** to be working
**at least partially**.

## Description of the language
It is very cool

More detailed description will be available later.

## Running

`cargo run -- <filename.bm>`

## Examples
There is just one and it is absolutely [awful](samples/hello-world/hello-world.bm).
